# Text Customization

While some of the text in the Zype Roku SDK is hardcoded, most of text labels can be changed inside `source/text_labels_config.json`. The text is stored with the app's global node and can be accessed through `m.global.labels`. If you want to add your own text labels or change the existing text you are free to do so.
