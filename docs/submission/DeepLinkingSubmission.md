# Submitting Deep Linking Parameters

When submitting your app remember to include parameters for deep linking. If you forget to include them, Roku will reject your app and ask you for them later. You can include these parameters in the __Test Accounts__ text box under the __Support Information__.

__mediaType__ can be any of the following: movie, series, season, or episode.

__contentID__ is the video id for an active video. Roku expects the video to be playable when it deep links so you should use a free video's id.
