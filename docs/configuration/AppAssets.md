# What Images Should I Update

---

There are a handful of images that need to be updated when you are starting from scratch. Inside the _images_ folder, these images need to be updated with your assets.

__Note:__ You do not have to remove any of the existing images inside the _images_ folder. You just need to _replace_ select images with your image. To swap out the image, just rename your image to match the image you are trying to replace.

---

Below is a table with the filenames of the images that you will need to replace when customizing your app. The app icon is required, but the splash screen and overhead logo are optional. If you do not have the optional images, you can simply delete them from the _images_ folder so that the existing images do not show up in your app.
